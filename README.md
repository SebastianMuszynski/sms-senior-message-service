## How it works

1. There is a special phone number (SPN).
2. Family members can register their parents and grandparents by sending their mobile phone numbers to the SPN through text message. 
3. A welcoming message is sent to the registered user (usually a senior) along with information about the service and available features. 
4. The users (seniors) from now on can ask for anything they need by sending a text message. It is like their personal assistant. 
5. There is a web platform on which all the sent questions appear. They are being automatically classified based on their content into one of the following categories: 
  - Info – any questions about the coronavirus situation, etc. 
  - Daily Help – asking for help with groceries, bills, repair services, etc. 
  - Medical Assistance – a need to consult with a doctor, observing first symptoms, etc. 
  - Loneliness – feeling lonely, asking for somebody to talk to. 
6. Authorised staff members can answer the questions online. 
7. The answer is being sent back to the person who asked a question.
